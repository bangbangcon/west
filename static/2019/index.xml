      <description>Transparency report: Reported Code of Conduct violations for 2019 Introduction !!Con West&amp;rsquo;s Code of Conduct is a document that guides us to build a joyful, exciting, and safe community for attendees from all walks of life. If we had our way, the entire world would be as we want !!Con to model, but the reality is that we&amp;rsquo;re still learning just how to make that world; our Code of Conduct both guides us in how to act positively, and provides a set of principles to see if we have missed the mark.</description>

As such, we need your help to keep !!Con West open and available to all. In exchange, we&amp;rsquo;d love to help put your company in front of our 200+ smart, creative, thoughtful participants.</description>
