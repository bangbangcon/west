<h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of conduct</h1>

<p>We value the participation of each member of the !!Con West community and want all
attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all
attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees
throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially
sponsored by !!Con West or not.</p>

<p>All attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any !!Con West
event are required to observe the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will
enforce this code throughout the event.</p>

<p><strong>Why have a code of conduct?</strong> Not because we feel like we&rsquo;re expected to have
one; not because someone told us to; not because we heard somewhere that it was
important for some reason &ndash; but <strong>as part of an intentional effort to define
the culture of !!Con West.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-short-version">The short version</h2>

<p>!!Con West is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, religion, or anything else. We do not tolerate
harassment of conference participants in any form.</p>

<p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not
appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.</p>

<p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary
jokes are not appropriate for !!Con West.</p>

<p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference at the sole
discretion of the conference organizers.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>

<h2 id="the-longer-version">The longer version</h2>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual
images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
inappropriate physical contact, derisive comments regarding technical
background, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.</p>

<p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other
exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and
offensive jokes are not appropriate for !!Con West.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates our code of conduct,
the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.</p>

<h3 id="guidelines-for-speakers">Guidelines for speakers</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a speaker &ndash; thank you!  We&rsquo;ve been really lucky to have speakers
who give thoughtful and exciting talks that are almost always inclusive of
the people in the !!Con audience.</p>

<p>Here are a few guidelines you can use to help make your talk even more
welcoming to everyone in the !!Con community:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Give people a heads up if you&rsquo;re discussing sensitive topics.</strong>  If your
talk includes descriptions of hurtful experiences that attendees might
share, let us know about it!  Some of these include transphobic,
homophobic, sexually-motivated, racially-motivated, or
religiously-motivated abuse and harassment; sexual assault; eating
disorders; mental illness and self-harm; or relationship abuse.  It&rsquo;s not
possible to give a full list, but these are some examples of things that
we hope you&rsquo;ll be sensitive of.  If you expect to cover these topics, <strong>talk
to the !!Con organizers before the conference</strong> so that we can let attendees
know these topics will be covered in your talk.  If you want to discuss a
sensitive topic in your talk and you&rsquo;d like help approaching it, let us
know and we&rsquo;ll be happy to brainstorm with you.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Avoid unnecessarily violent and sexual imagery.</strong>  Sometimes, including
these is unavoidable, or is central to the point of the talk, and that&rsquo;s
okay.  But sometimes, the imagery isn&rsquo;t necessary.  This can be in overt
ways (for example sexual images) or in more subtle ways (like an indirect
sexual reference used as a joke).  So before your talk, take one more look
over your slides and prep material in this light &ndash; and if you explicitly
plan to include sexual or violent content, consider how you can
contextualize it.  (One more note on this: if you plan to include
graphically violent content, please do let us know in advance.)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Talk to the experts.</strong>  !!Con thrives at the intersection of computers
and the human experience.  Many of us have become experts in technologies
just by reading about them, but this doesn&rsquo;t always work when real people
become involved!  If you plan to include anecdotes about the experiences
of a minority group you&rsquo;re not a member of in your talk, make sure you&rsquo;ve
spoken with someone from that group first.  They can help guide you on
what language would accurately capture their experience, and how to do it
with sensitivity.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Often, talks won&rsquo;t need to make any changes at all to address these!  But
even if your talk is mostly about computers, taking 10 minutes to go through
it and look for some of these issues (even if they&rsquo;re subtle!) goes a long
way to keeping !!Con welcoming for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="social-rules">Social rules</h2>

<p>In addition to having a code of conduct as an anti-harassment policy, we have a
small set of <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules">social rules</a>
we follow. We (the organizers) learned and lifted these rules from <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">the Recurse
Center</a> in New York, where we felt that they
contributed enormously to a supportive, productive, and fun learning
environment. We&rsquo;d like !!Con West to share that environment. These rules are
intended to be lightweight, and to make more explicit certain social norms that
are normally implicit. Most of our social rules really boil down to &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be a
jerk&rdquo; or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be annoying.&rdquo; Of course, almost nobody sets out to be a jerk or
annoying, so telling people not to be jerks isn&rsquo;t a very productive strategy.</p>

<p>Unlike the anti-harassment policy, violation of the social rules will not result
in expulsion from the conference or a strong warning from conference organizers.
Rather, they are designed to provide some lightweight social structure for
conference attendees to use when interacting with each other.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about any part of the code of conduct or social rules,
please feel free to reach out to any of the conference organizers.</p>

<h2 id="contact-information">Contact information</h2>

<p>Conference staff will be happy to do whatever we can to help those experiencing
