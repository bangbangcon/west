<h1 id="where-is-con-west-2019">Where is !!Con West 2019?</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;re excited to bring <strong>!!Con West 2019</strong> to scenic Santa Cruz, California,
on the campus of <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz</a>, on February 23rd
and 24th.  Santa Cruz is a joy of coastal California redwoods, about an
hour&rsquo;s drive from the bustle of Silicon Valley.  We&rsquo;ll be holding <strong>!!Con
West</strong> in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jack+Baskin+Auditorium+101/@36.9997031,-122.0630586,17.32z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808e4175229558fb:0x8d521799d868891c!8m2!3d37.000183!4d-122.0623527">Jack Baskin
Auditorium</a>
from about 10am to 5pm each day.</p>

<h2 id="event-size">Event size</h2>

<p>We anticipate having capacity for approximately <strong>175 attendees</strong> at this
year&rsquo;s <strong>!!Con West</strong>, in addition to our speakers and organizers.</p>

<h2 id="alcohol-free-and-all-ages">Alcohol-free and all-ages</h2>

<p><strong>!!Con West</strong> is an <strong>alcohol-free event</strong>.  All ages are welcome.</p>

<h2 id="gender-neutral-restrooms">Gender-neutral restrooms</h2>

same building as the auditorium; additionally, there are gender-labeled
restrooms in adjacent buildings.</p>

<h2 id="lactation-room">Lactation room</h2>

<p>A secure, private space will be made available for anybody who needs a
lactation room.  Please ask a conference organizer, and we&rsquo;ll be happy to

<h2 id="cart-captioning">CART captioning</h2>

<p><strong>!!Con West</strong> will have CART (&ldquo;Communication Access Realtime
Transcription&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Computer-Assisted Real-Time&rdquo;, depending on who you ask)
live transcription in English.  Our <a href="https://www.twilio.com">captioning sponsor this year is
Twilio</a>; we are incredibly grateful to Twilio for
their support in our mission of making <strong>!!Con West</strong> accessible to
everybody!</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-santa-cruz">Getting to Santa Cruz</h2>

<p>We are committed to making <strong>!!Con West</strong> accessible to as many attendees as we
can, and are searching for more transportation options. We will update this
section as we find more of them!</p>

<h3 id="by-car">By car</h3>

<p>The best way to get to Santa Cruz from most of the Peninsula is by way of CA-17,
which takes you from CA-85 through the Santa Cruz mountains into the city;
this takes about 45 minutes with no traffic.  Another option, if coming from
San Francisco, is to drive down by way of Half Moon Bay on CA-1, which would
take about an hour and a half without traffic.  Of course, since this is the
Bay Area, both of these routes are in fact prone to traffic, which could
delay you substantially, especially during peak hours!  On rainy days,
CA-17&rsquo;s mountain roads have been known to take some overconfident drivers by
surprise, so be extra careful and anticipate delays from crashes if
conditions are less-than-perfect.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in carpooling, please join <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/conwestcarpool/shared_invite/enQtNTM5OTU4NzgyNTk2LWJmZWU5MDI1YWRiOGY5ZjdkZjZhYjU4NGU0MDNiZThjMWFjYzU2OThmZmEwZjJhZjFmY2FjOGRiMzUyY2VmMjM">our carpool slack</a> and find your carpool buddies.</p>

<h3 id="by-air">By air</h3>

<p>The best options for getting in and out of the Bay Area by air are either
through San Francisco (SFO), or through San Jose (SJC).  There are tradeoffs
for each; there are more flights in and out of SFO, but SJC is about half an
hour to an hour closer to Santa Cruz. Both airports have shuttle options to
Santa Cruz, if you don&rsquo;t wish to rent a car (UCSC has a decent
<a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/travel/airport-shuttles.html">list of options</a>).</p>

<h3 id="by-other-alternatives-including-public-transit">By other alternatives including public transit</h3>

<p>Santa Cruz is somewhat remote and the public transit options are limited,
but getting there without driving or flying is possible!</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.greyhound.com">Greyhound</a> options from
San Francisco and Oakland to <a href="https://locations.greyhound.com/bus-stations/US/Santa-Cruz">Santa Cruz Greyhound Station</a>.</p>

<p>The nearest Amtrak/Caltrain station is San Jose Diridon Station (SJC).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re coming from Anaheim, Burbank, or Los Angeles and wish to take a bus,
<a href="https://us.megabus.com/">Megabus</a> also offers a few options to San Jose Diridon Station (SJC).</p>

<p>From San Jose Diridon Station to Santa Cruz, you can take:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.scmtd.com/en/component/systemmap/17/20192">Highway 17 Express</a>
bus</li>
<li><a href="https://www.greyhound.com">Greyhound</a></li>
<li>a taxi (estimated cost about $100)</li>
<li>a rideshare (estimated cost about $50)</li>
</ul>

<p>Extremely adventurous attendees could choose to bike to Santa Cruz; from the
middle of the Peninsula, <a href="https://www.strava.com/routes/11228019">one possible
route</a> is about 45 miles with about
3,800ft of elevation gain.  (If you try this, or have a better route, <a href="mailto:bangbangcon.west@gmail.com">let
us know</a>!)</p>

<h3 id="parking-at-ucsc">Parking at UCSC</h3>

<p>Please park at <a href="https://www.maps.ucsc.edu/content/directions-core-west-parking-structure">Core West Parking Structure</a> if you drive to the campus. Parking is free on the weekends. You can check <a href="https://mobile.ucsc.edu/parking/corewest">here</a> for a live information on open parking spaces.</p>

<h3 id="from-santa-cruz-city-center-to-jack-baskin-auditorium-without-a-car">From Santa Cruz city center to Jack Baskin Auditorium without a car</h3>

<p>Santa Cruz Metro offers several bus lines within the city; a few of them will
get you to the auditorium from the city center. Please consult the <a href="https://www.scmtd.com/en/routes">Santa Cruz
Metro website</a> or Google Maps for the bus
schedule.</p>

<p>There are both rideshare options (Lyft, etc.) and car sharing options
(Zipcar) available in Santa Cruz.</p>

<h3 id="shuttle-to-from-jack-baskin-auditorium">Shuttle to/from Jack Baskin Auditorium</h3>

<p>We will have free shuttles for the attendees! The shuttle schedule will be the same for both conference days. The times shown are the depart times from the pick-up location.</p>

<p>Depending on the road condition, the shuttles might arrive 5-10 minute late.
Hampton Inn is graciously letting !!Con West use the hotel as a shuttle stop. They have a tiny lobby, and they asked us to wait out front. They have a large overhang, so you will stay dry!</p>
