<p>We&rsquo;re excited to bring <strong>!!Con West 2020</strong> to scenic Santa Cruz, California,
on the campus of <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz</a>, from February 29
to March 1. Santa Cruz is a joy of coastal California redwoods, about an
hour&rsquo;s drive from the bustle of Silicon Valley. We will hold <strong>!!Con
West</strong> in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jack+Baskin+Auditorium+101/@36.9997031,-122.0630586,17.32z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808e4175229558fb:0x8d521799d868891c!8m2!3d37.000183!4d-122.0623527">Jack Baskin
Auditorium</a>,
with registration starting at 9am each day, and talks ending around 5pm.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-santa-cruz">Getting to Santa Cruz</h2>

<h3 id="by-car-from-the-bay-area">By car from the Bay Area</h3>

<ul>
<li>The best way to get to Santa Cruz from most of the Peninsula is by way of
CA-17, which takes you from CA-85 through the Santa Cruz mountains into the
city.</li>
<li>Please make sure you leave sufficiently early, as CA-17 gets heavy traffic
southbound on weekends.</li>
<li>Another option, if coming from San Francisco, is to drive down by way of Half
Moon Bay on CA-1, which would take about an hour and a half without traffic.</li>
<li>On rainy days, CA-17 can present adverse conditions, including car crashes and
mudslides, sometimes even leading to closure of the highway and long delays.</li>
<li>Please make sure to drive carefully and check the local news for transit
conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="by-air">By air</h3>

<p>The best options for getting in and out of the Bay Area by air are either
through San Francisco (SFO), or through San Jose (SJC).  There are tradeoffs
for each; there are more flights in and out of SFO, but SJC is about half an
hour to an hour closer to Santa Cruz. Both airports have shuttle options to
Santa Cruz, if you don&rsquo;t wish to rent a car (UCSC has a decent
<a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/travel/airport-shuttles.html">list of options</a>).</p>

<h3 id="by-other-alternatives-including-public-transit">By other alternatives including public transit</h3>

<ul>
<li>Santa Cruz is somewhat remote and the public transit options are limited, but
getting there without driving or flying is possible!</li>
<li>There are <a href="https://www.greyhound.com">Greyhound</a> options from San Francisco
and Oakland to <a href="https://locations.greyhound.com/bus-stations/US/Santa-Cruz">Santa Cruz Greyhound
Station</a>.</li>
<li>The nearest Amtrak/Caltrain station is San Jose Diridon Station (SJC).</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re coming from Anaheim, Burbank, or Los Angeles and wish to take a bus,
<a href="https://us.megabus.com/">Megabus</a> also offers a few options to San Jose
Diridon Station (SJC).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="from-san-jose-diridon-station-to-santa-cruz-you-can-take">From San Jose Diridon Station to Santa Cruz, you can take:</h3>

<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://www.scmtd.com/en/component/systemmap/17/20192">Highway 17
Express</a> bus</li>
<li><a href="https://www.greyhound.com">Greyhound</a></li>
<li>a taxi (estimated cost about $100)</li>
<li>a rideshare (estimated cost about $50)</li>
</ul>

<p>Extremely adventurous attendees could choose to bike to Santa Cruz; from the
middle of the Peninsula, <a href="https://www.strava.com/routes/11228019">one possible
route</a> is about 45 miles with about
3,800ft of elevation gain. (If you try this, or have a better route, <a href="mailto:west-2020@exclamation.foundation">let us
know</a>!)</p>

which is about a 5-minute walk from the auditorium. There are accessible parking
spaces closer to the venue. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://mobile.ucsc.edu/parking/corewest">mobile-friendly website with live

<p>Santa Cruz Metro offers several bus lines within the city; a few of them will
get you to the auditorium from the city center. Please consult the <a href="https://www.scmtd.com/en/routes">Santa Cruz
Metro website</a> or Google Maps for the bus
schedule.</p>

<h3 id="by-rideshare">By rideshare</h3>

<p>There are both rideshare options (Lyft, etc.) and car sharing options (Zipcar)
available in Santa Cruz.</p>
