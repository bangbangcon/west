<h1 id="sponsor-con-west">Sponsor !!Con West!</h1>

<p>!!Con is a tremendous amount of fun, and we think that it brings a lot of
value to its attendees, and to the programming community at large.  But
!!Con also costs money to run, and we&rsquo;re committed to making sure that it
remains affordable to everybody who wants to participate.</p>

<p>As such, we need your help to keep !!Con West open and available to all.  In
exchange, we&rsquo;d love to help put your company in front of our 200+ smart,
creative, thoughtful participants.  Several sponsorship levels are
available. If you have any questions, please <a href="mailto:bangbangcon.west@gmail.com">contact
us.</a></p>
