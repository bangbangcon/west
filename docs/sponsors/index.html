<h1 id="sponsor-con-west">Sponsor !!Con West!</h1>

<p>!!Con is a tremendous amount of fun, and we think that it brings a lot of value
to its attendees, and to the programming community at large.  But !!Con also
costs money to run, and we&rsquo;re committed to making sure that it remains
affordable to everybody who wants to participate.</p>

<p>As such, we need your help to keep !!Con West open and available to all.  In
exchange, we&rsquo;d love to help put your company in front of our 200+ smart,
creative, thoughtful participants.  Below are some sponsorship tiers that
we&rsquo;ve put together as starting points, but we&rsquo;re happy to customize a
package to meet the needs of your organization!  If you&rsquo;re interested in
sponsoring us, please <a href="mailto:west-2020@exclamation.foundation">send us some
mail</a>; we&rsquo;d love to chat.</p>

<h4 id="a-note-about-employee-tickets">A note about employee tickets</h4>

<p>Space at !!Con West is limited, so we humbly request that these tickets go to
employees of your company who will really enjoy the subject matter of the talks.
What that means will depend on the company, but it&rsquo;s likely to mean
programmer/engineer employees or programming enthusiasts.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sponsor-a-conference-element">Sponsor a conference element!</h2>

<p>One way that your organization can stand out is by sponsoring specific
portions and features of the conference.  Below, we have some ideas for
elements that this would fit well with.  Attendees really remember the names
of sponsors of the unique elements of !!Con, so these can be an opportunity
for very good value and visibility for your company!  If these interest you,
<a href="mailto:west-2020@exclamation.foundation">get in touch</a> and we can talk
about including them in your sponsorship package.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Live streaming and recording.</strong> All of !!Con West&rsquo;s talks are broadcast
in real time to viewers around the world; we&rsquo;ve even heard of groups
organizing &ldquo;!!Con watch parties&rdquo;!  We also record and upload all of
!!Con West&rsquo;s talks for anyone to watch on YouTube.  Having your
organization&rsquo;s name associated with streaming and video-on-demand is the
sponsorship gift that keeps on giving!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Live captioning.</strong> !!Con West aims to be a radically inclusive
conference, and one of the most visible ways that we act on that is by
hiring a captioner to transcribe each speaker in realtime.  Our experience
is that captioning is useful not just to audience members with
disabilities, but to everyone, giving people more options to engage with
our amazing speakers.  If accessibility is important to your organization,
a great way to demonstrate that is by having your name displayed right
alongside the caption feed all day long, and we&rsquo;d love to offer that to
you!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Shuttle services for attendees and speakers.</strong> Baskin Auditorium is
three miles away from Santa Cruz downtown, where many attendees will be
staying and socializing.  At the end of our two joyful days of !!Con, our
attendees will have shuttles available to them to get them into town &ndash;
something that we&rsquo;ve heard has been very useful!  Your company&rsquo;s name
could go on this valuable service.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Sponsor a meal.</strong> Lunch and snack breaks have been some of the most
exciting parts of !!Cons, when attendees come together and &ldquo;unconference&rdquo;
&ndash; not to mention getting the joy of getting to fill your stomach after a
morning of invigorating talks!  Our experience at conferences is that
everybody remembers who fed them, and sponsor-associated food has been a
big hit at the New York version of !!Con in the past.  We&rsquo;d be happy to
get your name on the lunch or snack tables, and build some Pavlovian
associations of joy with your company!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, these are just ideas to start off with &ndash; there&rsquo;s a lot of !!Con
that we&rsquo;d like to share with you!  If you have other ideas, we&rsquo;d love to
hear about them and work with you &ndash; feel free to <a href="mailto:west-2020@exclamation.foundation">contact
us</a>!</p>
