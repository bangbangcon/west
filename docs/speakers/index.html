<span class="talk-title">Glitch Nuggets of Resistance!</span></p>

<p>This talk introduces a concept of glitch, or error/failure, which also
serves as an entry point for activists, by drawing on my book project titled
<em>Glitch Resistance: the Arab Uprisings, Social Media, and the Virtual Body
Politic</em>.  If glitch does violence to the surface of the image, it also
enables us to see more, by questioning the source, revealing the material
support of the digital ether, and suggesting how images are recomposed in
circulation.  I will demonstrate how to apply this theory of the glitch onto
an aesthetics of abstraction by drawing on live performances, installation,
and digital arts.</p>

<span class="talk-title">The Conjuring: ransomware edition!!</span></p>

<p>Ransomware is malevolent software that possesses hosts, holds files hostage,
and allows its dark masters to perform extortion.  This form of malware
seeks to infect weak hosts, acquires a unique encryption secret, encrypts
user data using this secret incantation (key), locks away the key so the
victim cannot obtain it, and finally exhibits signs of possession (ransom
notes).  Once the possession takes hold, no exorcist or security expert can
help.</p>

<p>But how does ransomware really function?  What does it take to successfully
carry out the biggest financially motivated cybercrime operations?  How does
ransomware infiltrate hosts?  Where does it acquire the unique encryption
key needed to encrypt each victim&rsquo;s data?  How does it hide this key from victims?
Why is data recovery infeasible without the key?</p>

<p>In this talk, we discuss the intricacies of a ransomware infection.  We
follow the process of host infiltration, communication with malware&rsquo;s
command and control server, key management on host, file encryption, and
finally the underground market of buying, selling, developing and
distributing ransomware.  We dissect real-world ransomware and show
demonstrations of the most successful ransomware variants in action!</p>

<p>The January 1, 2019 flyby of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(486958)_2014_MU69">(486958) 2014 MU69</a> by NASA&rsquo;s New Horizons
spacecraft made MU69 the most distant object ever visited by humanity.
However, MU69 is extremely faint, and only barely detectable with the Hubble
Space Telescope.  I will discuss how we made kernel density estimators for
the faint images from Hubble and combined them with Markov Chain Monte Carlo
techniques to build a probability cloud of where MU69 would be during the
encounter.  We also used this probability cloud to observe several stellar
occultations of MU69, watching stars blink out for less than a second in
order to tell us the size and shape of MU69.  These techniques show the
power of combining modern numerical probability estimates with a strong
forward model to pull the best possible prediction out of poor-quality data.</p>

instructions!</span></p>

<p>I like Lego, but the idea of making large sculptures without some sort of

that uses a 3D object or scan and converts it into a sort of Lego
instructions that I could use as a guide.  Easy giant Lego sculptures!
Well, easy to that step.  Actually getting the parts and putting it together
is a different talk.  Easy giant Lego sculpture &hellip; instructions!</p>

including some general thoughts about leveraging libraries in your code.</p>

<span class="talk-title">Computers are fast!  But how come they sometimes
feel slow?</span></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s super-important for computers to feel responsive.  Everyone from
academic HCI researchers to revenue-focused product managers have been
telling us this for years.  And yet, even as computers have gotten faster
and faster, it often feels like the software we use daily has gotten slower!</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the deal with that?  Why is latency so hard to minimize, and how can we
even measure or detect that?  How can we make things better for users, either
by making things speedier or just making it feel like they are?</p>

as competitive-level gamers demanding frame-perfect input over severe
network constraints are a particularly extreme (and interesting!) edge case.</p>

Breadmaking Skills with Open-Source Monitoring!!</span></p>

<p>I love to bake.  A few months ago, I became interested in the art of
making one&rsquo;s own sourdough, a type of bread that, due to its fermentation
process, is a much healthier alternative to bread that is
readily available today.  The sourdough breadmaking process is a
fascinating combination of biology and physics, but working with natural
starters can be difficult because they are very sensitive to variations in
temperature and humidity.</p>

<p>It is fun and useful to leverage inexpensive sensors, Raspberry Pis, and
Prometheus (a monitoring system written in Go) to monitor the humidity and
temperature of my sourdough cultures in order to gain insight into how these
parameters affect the growth of each type of culture.  The result?
Analytical insights into an age-old breadmaking process via graphical
reports and alerting rules.</p>

<p>I am going to share my delicious and metric-filled breadmaking process,
hopefully inspiring attendees to see how modern-day tooling written in Go
can be used to enhance traditional fields.</p>

<span class="talk-title">Software patterns &hellip; from the 9th century?!!</span></p>

<p>In 9th-century Europe, agriculture underwent a major refactoring &mdash; all to
change a single magic constant.  Traditionally, farmers left half their land
uncultivated, to let it recover depleted nutrients; now they started leaving
only a third fallow.  This generates 33% more food on the same land!  Sounds
like an easy win, right?</p>

<p>Not so fast.  The new three-field system took nearly two centuries to get
fully deployed to production!  Not everyone was happy with the pull request,
and a lot of infrastructure needed reconfiguring to support the new model.</p>

<p>Sound familiar?  It should!  We sometimes convince ourselves programming is
an exceptional discipline, with new and unique challenges.  But many of our
craft&rsquo;s deepest problems are more general than we realize.  Backward
compatibility; systematic trade-offs; pipelines and bottlenecks; the
importance of good tooling &mdash; all of these had their part to play in the long
and difficult transition from two- to three-field agriculture.</p>

<span class="talk-title">The secret life of Not-a-Number!</span></p>

<p>In this talk we&rsquo;ll talk about NaN-boxing, an especially beautiful bit-level
hack that might be running on your computer right now!</p>

<p>The floating point standard defines a special value called Not-a-Number
(NaN) which is used to represent, well, things that aren&rsquo;t numbers.  Double
precision NaNs come with a payload of 51 bits which can be used for whatever
you want &mdash; including using the payload to represent <em>all other</em>
non-floating point values and their types at runtime in dynamically typed
languages.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll look at some juicy details of JavaScriptCore, Safari&rsquo;s javascript
interpreter, where everything is a float!</p>

<p><strong>Annie</strong> loves bit-patterns, though she does not execute raw binary
herself.  She could, but she doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<span class="talk-title">Value Your Types!</span></p>

<p>You&rsquo;re probably familiar with types in programming languages, such as
&ldquo;integer&rdquo; or &ldquo;list of integers.&rdquo; But what if your type system were powerful
enough to express types like &ldquo;non-negative integer&rdquo; or &ldquo;list of strings
where each string is at least eight characters long&rdquo;?  Welcome to the world
of dependent types!  In this talk, we&rsquo;ll explore what dependent types are,
how they work, and the relationship between type theory and predicate logic,
all using the Idris programming language.  We&rsquo;ll even see when type checking
can become (gasp) undecidable!</p>

<p><strong>Eric Weinstein</strong> writes poems and programs.  He&rsquo;s currently thinking a lot
about machine qualia, game theory in online auctions, and applied ethics in
software engineering (for both human and artificial moral agents).</p>

<span class="talk-title">Postgres plays Pok&eacute;mon!</span></p>

<p>Pok&eacute;mon is a pretty fun game.  You have a bunch of numbers, they do a
bunch of math to other numbers, and then you get to hear triumphant music!
But the interface leaves a lot to be desired.  What if you could augment
that clunky RPG-based gameplay with an exciting SQL-based UI?  Join me on an
exciting journey with emulator internals, Z80 assembly, and extremely
overpowered Magikarp!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to answer that age-old question: how does my laptop always <em>know</em>
how to load that Harry Potter slashfic on Tumblr?</p>

<p>Featuring some old photos, a lot of hand-drawn diagrams, and <abbr

into how the world&rsquo;s largest, most redundant, and most distributed phonebook
<strong>looks</strong> like it&rsquo;s working, but actually secretly fails a lot of the time.</p>

<span class="talk-title">Generating fractals &hellip; with SQL queries!!!</span></p>

<p>SQL databases can do a lot.  They are fantastic at making it easy to work
with large amounts of data.  One of the lesser-known capabilities of SQL
databases is that they can be used to generate fractals!</p>

<p>In this talk, we&rsquo;ll take a look at how you can use the SQL features provided
by Postgres to generate fractals.  Through the clever use of these features,
you can generate a wide range of fractals including Sierpinski&rsquo;s triangle,
the Mandelbrot set, and Hilbert curves.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Malis</strong> leads the database team at Heap.  For his day job he
works on optimizing a petabyte-scale Postgres cluster.  His hobbies include
bouldering and meditating.</p>

<span class="talk-title">Keeping abandoned watches ticking!</span></p>

<p>These days, it&rsquo;s hard to find anything that doesn&rsquo;t need The Cloud.  This
has revolutionised the world!  It has also led us to a world where you can
buy a perfectly good device and it will suddenly stop working the next day.
What happens next?</p>

<p>I will talk about the demise of the Pebble smartwatch, and how the community
worked to keep them ticking.  Featuring: clouds, reverse engineering,
sustainable services, and a plentiful supply of &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; solutions to
unexpected problems.</p>

<p><strong>Katharine</strong> spent several years trying to make smartwatches at Pebble
(which failed) and trying to make smartglasses at Intel (which also failed).
She&rsquo;s currently hoping Google will not suffer the same fate.  Some say
Katharine owns more little ponies than really necessary, which is of
course impossible.</p>

<p>I work on smart microwave ovens. We don&rsquo;t tweet images of each food you cook.
Instead, we focus on moving heat around inside the device, directing it to
where we want it. We can cook two different foods to two different
temperatures! How does this work?  Linear algebra, heuristics, and some clever
hardware. Join me as I give an introduction to the magic that makes this work!</p>

<span class="talk-title">&ldquo;Wheels within whiles!&rdquo; or possibly &ldquo;Whiles within
wheels!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>I built a multi-layer stack of emulations to include 150 years of digital
computing tech &mdash; from a (relatively) modern laptop through 5 layers of
emulation to Charles Babbage&rsquo;s 1840&rsquo;s Difference Engine &mdash; using various
bits of code I had lying around.  In the process, I asked
myself: <em>&ldquo;why do I have that code lying around!?!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>This started me thinking about emulation, the whys and ways of its uses:</p>

<ul>
<li>A practical way to extend the life of mature software</li>
<li>A tool for conservation, to help understand the design[er]s of past machines</li>
<li>An aid to communication with possibly remote co-designers on future machines</li>
</ul>

<p>Emulation can help communicate through space and time!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll go over some of my favorite layers from that emulation stack and talk
about aspects of each, and lessons learned along the way.</p>

<p>The day <strong>Mike</strong> was born, you could count the fully functional stored
program electronic digital computers in the world on the fingers of one
hand.  He started messing with tech (mostly telecom and video games) when
transistors were overtaking tubes in computers, and has long been interested
in the history of technology to better understand the human context of its
development, &ldquo;how we got here&rdquo;, and the roads not taken.</p>

<span class="talk-title"><code>if</code> &hellip; <code>then</code> &hellip; <code>else</code> had to be
invented!</span></p>

<p>60 years ago, several of the world&rsquo;s foremost computer scientists came
together to create the first international programming language standard.
The language they created, Algol, is remembered for introducing block
structure and for sparking controversy over exactly what it means to pass a
parameter to a function.  But Algol&rsquo;s creators also wrestled for years with
the core question of how to communicate that in one circumstance a computer
should do a certain thing, and in different circumstances it should do
something different.  I will describe the paradigm of conditional program
execution that existed before Algol, the alternatives that the language&rsquo;s
creators considered, the final form they chose, and how it shaped our
thoughts going forward.</p>
