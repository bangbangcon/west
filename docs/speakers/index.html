<p><span class="talk-title">The Conjuring: ransomware edition!!</span></p>

<p>Ransomware is malevolent software that possesses host, holds files hostage,
and allows its dark masters to perform extortion.  This form of malware
seeks to infect weak hosts, acquires a unique encryption secret, encrypts
user data using this secret incantation (key), locks away the key so the
victim cannot obtain it, and finally exhibits signs of possession (ransom
notes).  Once the possession takes hold, no exorcist or security expert can
help.</p>

<p>But how does ransomware really function?  What does it take to successfully
carry out the biggest financially motivated cybercrime operation?  How does
ransomware infiltrate hosts?  Where does it acquire the unique encryption
key needed to encrypt each victim?  How does it hide this key from victims?
Why is data recovery infeasible without the key?</p>

<p>In this talk, we discuss the intricacies of a ransomware infection.  We
follow the process of host infiltration, communication with malware&rsquo;s
command and control server, key management on host, file encryption, and
finally the underground market of buying, selling, developing and
distributing ransomware.  We dissect real-world ransomware and show
demonstrations of the most successful ransomware variants in action!</p>

<p>The January 1, 2019 flyby of 2014 MU69 &ldquo;Ultima Thule&rdquo; by NASA&rsquo;s New Horizons
spacecraft made MU69 the most distant object ever visited by humanity.
However, MU69 is extremely faint, and only barely detectable with the Hubble
Space Telescope.  I will discuss how we made kernel density estimators for
the faint images from Hubble and combined them with Markov Chain Monte Carlo
techniques to build a probability cloud of where MU69 would be during the
encounter.  We also used this probability cloud to observe several stellar
occultations of MU69, watching stars blink out for less than a second in
order to tell us the size and shape of MU69.  These techniques show the
power of combining modern numerical probability estimates with a strong
forward model to pull the best possible prediction out of poor-quality data.</p>

<span class="talk-title">Computers are fast!  But how come they sometimes
feel slow?</span></p>

<p>As computers have gotten faster over the years, it often doesn&rsquo;t feel like
they&rsquo;re more responsive in moment-to-moment tasks.  While many product
managers can cite hard numbers about how quickly user engagement drops off
as apps or websites are slower, human factors researchers similarly shout
from the rooftops that low input latency is essential to letting users feel
like a system is responsive.  What&rsquo;s the deal with that?  Why is latency so
hard to minimize, and what tools do we even have for measuring it?  How can
we make things better for users, either by making things speedier or just
making it feel like they are?</p>

<p>This talk will cover all of that and more.  It&rsquo;ll particularly focus on
interesting edge cases from games, such as extreme networking latency and
competitive-level players demanding frame-perfect input, and discuss how we
can carry lessons learned from those over to non-game software development.</p>

breadmaking skills with open-source monitoring!!</span></p>

<p>How can you leverage sensors, open-source software, and Go to improve your
kitchen skills?  This lightning talk explores the relationship between
bread-making, humidity, and temperature, and how one can use monitoring
tools to gain insight into the lively world of sourdough cultures.</p>

<p>I love to bake.  A few months ago, I became quite interested in the art of
making one&rsquo;s own sourdough, a type of bread that due to its fermentation
process, is a much healthier alternative to the type of bread that is
readily available today.  The sourdough bread-making process is a
fascinating combination of biology and physics, but working with natural
starters can be difficult because they are very sensitive to variations in
temperature and humidity.  As a result, these parameters need to be closely
observed.</p>

<p>It is fun and useful to leverage inexpensive sensors, Raspberry Pis, and
Prometheus (a monitoring system written in Go) to monitor the humidity and
temperature of my sourdough cultures in order to gain insight into how these
parameters affect the growth of each type of culture.  The result?
Analytical insights into an age-old bread-making process via graphical
reports and alerting rules.</p>

<p>I am going to share my delicious and metric-filled bread-making process,

<span class="talk-title">Software patterns&hellip; from the 9th century?!!</span></p>

<p>In 9th century Europe, agriculture underwent a major refactoring ?  all to
change a single magic constant.  Traditionally, farmers left half their land
uncultivated, to let it recover depleted nutrients; now they started leaving
only a third fallow.  This generates 33% more food on the same land!  Sounds
like an easy win, right?</p>

<p>Not so fast.  The new three-field system took nearly two centuries to get
fully deployed to production!  Not everyone was happy with the pull request,
and a lot of infrastructure needed reconfiguring to support the new model.</p>

<p>Sound familiar?  It should!  We sometimes convince ourselves programming is
an exceptional discipline, with new and unique challenges.  But many of our
craft&rsquo;s deepest problems are more general than we realize.  Backward
compatibility; systematic trade-offs; pipelines and bottlenecks; the
importance of good tooling; all of these had their part to play in the long
and difficult transition from two- to three-field agriculture.</p>

<p>SQL databases can do a lot.  They are fantastic at making it easy to work
with large amounts of data.  One of the lesser know capabilities of SQL
databases is that they can be used to generate fractals!</p>

<p>In this talk, we&rsquo;ll take a look at how you can use the SQL features provided
by Postgres to generate fractals.  Through the clever use of these features,
you can generate a wide range of fractals including Sierpinski&rsquo;s triangle,
the Mandelbrot set, and Hilbert curves.</p>

works on optimizing a Petabyte scale Postgres cluster.  His hobbies include
bouldering and meditating.</p>

<p>We discuss an algorithm for playing chess &mdash; or Reversi, or

&mdash; and its surprising philosophical implications for cognitive science,
free will, and ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="talk-title">Keeping abandoned watches ticking!</span></p>

<p>These days, it&rsquo;s hard to find anything that doesn&rsquo;t need The Cloud.  This
has revolutionised the world!  It has also lead us to a world where you can
buy a perfectly good device and it will suddenly stop working the next day.
What happens next?</p>

<p>I will talk about the demise of the Pebble smartwatch, and how the community
worked to keep them ticking.  Featuring: clouds, reverse engineering,
sustainable services, and a plentiful supply of &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; solutions to
unexpected problems.</p>

<p><b>Katharine</b> spent several years trying to make smartwatches at Pebble
(which failed) and trying to make smartglasses at Intel (which also failed).
She&rsquo;s currently hoping Google will not suffer the same fate.  Some say
<b>Katharine</b> owns more little ponies than really necessary, which is of
course impossible.</p>

<p>I work on smart microwaves.  Not the &ldquo;let&rsquo;s put it on the internet and text
you images of your food&rdquo; kind of smart &ndash; &mdash; we can actually move heat
around inside the device, cooking two different foods to two different
temperatures.  How does this work?  Linear algebra, heuristics, and some
clever hardware.  Join me as I give an introduction to the magic that makes
this work!</p>

<p><span class="talk-title">&ldquo;Wheels within whiles!&rdquo; or possibly &ldquo;Whiles within
wheels!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>I built a multi-layer stack of emulations to include 150 years of digital
computing tech &mdash; from a (relatively) modern laptop through 5 layers of
emulation to Charles Babbage&rsquo;s 1840&rsquo;s Difference Engine &mdash; using various
bits of code I had lying around.  In the process of doing that, I asked
myself: <em>&ldquo;why do I have that code lying around!?!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>This started me thinking about emulation, the whys and ways of its uses:</p>

<ul>
<li>A practical way to extend the life of mature software</li>
<li>A tool for conservation, to help understand the design[er]s of past machines</li>
<li>An aid communication with possibly remote co-designers on future machines</li>
</ul>

<p>Emulation can help communicate through space and time!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll go over some of my favorite layers from that emulation stack and talk
about aspects of each, and lessons learned along the way.</p>

<p><b>Mike</b> has been messing with tech (mostly telecom and video games)
since transistors overtook tubes in computers.  He is interested in the
history of technology to better understand the human context of its
development, &ldquo;how we got here&rdquo;, and the roads not taken.</p>

<p><span class="talk-title"><code>if</code> &hellip; <code>then</code> &hellip; <code>else</code> had to be
invented!</span></p>

<p>60 years ago, several of the world&rsquo;s foremost computer scientists came
together to create the first international programming language standard.
The language they created, Algol, is remembered for introducing block
structure and for raising key questions about what it means to pass a
parameter to a function.  But Algol&rsquo;s creators also wrestled for years with
the core question of how to communicate that in one circumstance a computer
should do a certain thing, and that in different circumstances it should do
something different.  I will describe the paradigm of conditional program
execution that existed before Algol, the alternatives that were considered,
the final form that was chosen, and how it shaped our thoughts going
forward.</p>
