<h1 id="the-con-west-2020-call-for-proposals-is-closed">The !!Con West 2020 Call for Proposals is closed</h1>

<p>Thank you to everyone who submitted a proposal for !!Con West 2020!  The
Call for Proposals is now closed.  If you missed submitting to !!Con West
2020, please consider submitting to !!Con 2020 instead!</p>

<h1 id="give-a-talk-at-con-west">Give a talk at !!Con West!</h1>

<p>Hi! !!Con West is back for our <strong>second year</strong> of celebrating the joy, excitement,
and surprise of computing, and we
want <strong>you</strong> to submit a <a href="https://forms.gle/NhdiHHPN3uJ8Ywre6">talk proposal</a>. The <strong>submission deadline</strong> is
<strong>Sunday, December 8</strong>.</p>

<p>Since its launch five years ago, !!Con talks have featured everything from
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T75FvUDirNM">glowing mushrooms</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGkCSZ2dH5g">control
theory</a>; from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihqcgrR0azw">machine
knitting</a> to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LbEWD0gzGo">gliders</a>; from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY4t9IHFD4E">live coding on
an Apple II</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GiQovHaT_g">queer feminist
cyberpunk manifestos</a>. We’ve had
speakers who are programmers, poets, scientists, students, and more!  We’re
excited to bring this magic to the West Coast for the second time in 2020!</p>

<p>What’s an idea that delights you? Did you learn something surprising recently?
Is there a tool you love that you’ve been telling everyone about? Did you do
something with computers that seems impossible or amazing or just really fun?
Please take this call for talk proposals as an <a href="https://twitter.com/akaptur/status/583115830621184000">invitation to
meditate</a> on what you
find exciting and surprising and delightful about programming and computing, and
then <a href="https://forms.gle/NhdiHHPN3uJ8Ywre6">submit a talk</a> about one of those things!
The only requirements are that your talk:</p>

<ul>
<li>be computing-related!</li>
<li>be about something you think is interesting and cool!</li>
<li><strong>have at least one exclamation mark in the title!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We would <strong>especially</strong> like to hear from you if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you submitted a talk proposal to a previous !!Con that was rejected (we’ve
had to reject <strong>so many</strong> talk proposals we loved).</li>
<li>you’ve never spoken at a tech conference. Some of our favorite !!Con talks
have been from first-time speakers.</li>
<li>you find that people like you are underrepresented at programming
conferences. We’re committed to doing work to make !!Con West a good
experience for you. See our <a href="../conduct/">code of conduct</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>All talks will be ten minutes long</strong>. Ten minutes isn’t much time, so think
carefully about the scope of your talk and be clear in the
<a href="http://composition.al/blog/2017/06/30/how-to-write-a-timeline-for-a-bangbangcon-talk-proposal/">timeline</a>
about how you plan to spend the time. A single, focused idea is best – go for
“here’s my favorite assembly instruction” rather than “here’s an overview of how
assembly works”.</p>

<p>The submission deadline is <strong>Sunday, December 8th</strong>. We’ll accept as many of your
amazing talks as we can. You can submit more than one talk proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Proposals will be <a href="https://organicdonut.com/2018/03/the-con-talk-anonymization-and-selection-process/">anonymized to avoid bias</a></strong>. Although we ask for your name,
email address, and so on in the <a href="https://forms.gle/NhdiHHPN3uJ8Ywre6">proposal submission
form</a>, only one or two organizers who
serve as anonymizers will actually see this information, and they won’t review
your proposal. The rest of the <a href="../index.html#who-s-organizing">organizing team</a>
will review your proposal without knowing who you are.</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/NhdiHHPN3uJ8Ywre6">Submit your proposal today!</a></p>

<h2 id="important-dates">Important dates</h2>

<h2 id="speaker-travel-funding">Speaker travel funding</h2>

<p>!!Con West will be held at UC Santa Cruz in Santa Cruz, California, USA. We
offer financial assistance for travel expenses (stuff like flights, trains,
lodging, and meals while traveling) for outside-of-Santa Cruz speakers. If
you’re not from the Santa Cruz area and you want to request funding, please fill
out the relevant section of the <a href="https://forms.gle/NhdiHHPN3uJ8Ywre6">proposal submission
form</a>.</p>

<p>Because submissions are reviewed anonymously, requesting financial assistance
will not affect a proposal’s chances of acceptance.</p>

<h2 id="speaker-honorarium">Speaker honorarium</h2>

<p>Preparing an amazing conference talk is hard work. To show our appreciation,
we’re paying all our speakers a $256 (US) honorarium.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-about-travel">A note about travel</h2>

<p>We welcome all speakers, regardless of nationality. We generally expect that
accepted speakers who confirm their participation will travel to Santa Cruz to
present their talk in person. However, if any accepted speaker anticipates
visa-related difficulties in traveling to the conference, we will make
arrangements to enable remote participation, and not require them to attend the
conference in order to present their talk. In such a case <a href="mailto:west-2020@exclamation.foundation">contact
us</a> for further guidance.</p>

<p>Thanks for submitting to !!Con West!</p>
