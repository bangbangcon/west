<span class="talk-title">The Best Parts!  Of My Favorite Things!</span>

The software engineering ecosystem is so big!  How can you tell which tool
is best for which job, and what's going to give you the simplest path to get
a job done?  How do all of the various systems and tools complement each
other?  These are all questions you will have to answer on a regular basis,
and I want to help you!  We're going to go down the list, and I'm going to
tell you about all the best parts!  of my favorite things!  So, the next
time you think "wow, I really need to catch this mouse", you'll remember:
"oh hey, I heard cats are great at that!"

<span class="talk-title">Glitch Nuggets of Resistance!</span>

This talk introduces a concept of glitch, or error/failure, which also
serves as an entry point for activists, by drawing on my book project titled
_Glitch Resistance: the Arab Uprisings, Social Media, and the Virtual Body
Politic_.  If glitch does violence to the surface of the image, it also
enables us to see more, by questioning the source, revealing the material
support of the digital ether, and suggesting how images are recomposed in
circulation.  I will demonstrate how to apply this theory of the glitch onto
an aesthetics of abstraction by drawing on live performances, installation,
and digital arts.

<a href="http://vjumamel.com">**VJ Um Amel**</a> is the cyborg imagination and the virtual representation of Laila Shereen Sakr, a digital media theorist and artist.

<span class="talk-title">Help!  How do you let others know what's going on
when you're 8000 feet up in the air in a plane without an engine?!</span>

First of all: Keep calm and carry on!  Chances are that you are on board
a glider, which is flying perfectly well without an engine.  In this talk
you'll learn how glider pilots can travel hundreds of miles with just the
power of the sun, and how you can watch them do their thing with your feet
on the ground.  We'll discuss how modern technology makes this sport
spectator-friendly, and how all of this can be achieved with very low cost.

<span class="talk-title">The Conjuring: ransomware edition!!</span>

Ransomware is malevolent software that possesses hosts, holds files hostage,
and allows its dark masters to perform extortion.  This form of malware
seeks to infect weak hosts, acquires a unique encryption secret, encrypts
user data using this secret incantation (key), locks away the key so the
victim cannot obtain it, and finally exhibits signs of possession (ransom
notes).  Once the possession takes hold, no exorcist or security expert can
help.

But how does ransomware really function?  What does it take to successfully
carry out the biggest financially motivated cybercrime operations?  How does
ransomware infiltrate hosts?  Where does it acquire the unique encryption
key needed to encrypt each victim's data?  How does it hide this key from victims? 
Why is data recovery infeasible without the key?

In this talk, we discuss the intricacies of a ransomware infection.  We
follow the process of host infiltration, communication with malware's
command and control server, key management on host, file encryption, and
finally the underground market of buying, selling, developing and
distributing ransomware.  We dissect real-world ransomware and show
demonstrations of the most successful ransomware variants in action!

**Pranshu Bajpai** ([@amirootyet](https://twitter.com/amirootyet)) is a security
researcher working towards his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at
Michigan State University.  His research interests lie in computer and
network security, malware analysis, digital forensics, and cyber crimes.  In
the past, he worked as a penetration tester.  He has been an active speaker
at conferences and spoken at DEFCON, APWG eCrime conference, GrrCon, ToorCon, CascadiaJS,

<span class="talk-title">Let's translate old video games!  How do they even
work?!</span>

Old video games were made under incredible technical pressures that are
almost unimaginable to programmers today &mdash; so why don't we imagine them?  I
will share my experience translating the *Lunar* series of Japanese role-playing games
from the 1990s.  We'll learn how text was represented in the '90s, how we can
find text hidden in binary file formats, and how we can replace it.  Along
the way, we'll learn about the kinds of techniques programmers used when
faced with tight limitations.

**Misty De M&eacute;o** works on internal tools at GitHub and is a member
of the Homebrew package manager development team.  She also likes old video
games a bit too much, and uses her degree in archival studies to dabble in

system!</span>

EarthBound, a role-playing game released for the Super Nintendo in 1994, is
one of the most universally revered games of all time.  At the core of
EarthBound is a super-complex scripting language that controls text,
scripted cutscenes, music, sound effects, window management, and more.  In

<span class="talk-title">How to calculate the phase of the moon very, very
badly!</span>

This talk is about how, despite "common knowledge", lunar cycles are not 28
days long, and in fact lunar cycles don't have a single numerical length!
You'll hear about several very bad ways to calculate the phases of the moon,
why they seemed reasonable at the time, and exactly how it took three years
from the time one app shipped to the App Store before the calendar was even
arguably correct.

**Andr&eacute;** aspires to one day make computers do his bidding,

<span class="talk-title">Guiding a starship with noise! And blinking!</span>

The January 1, 2019 flyby of [(486958) 2014 MU69](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(486958)_2014_MU69) by NASA's New Horizons
spacecraft made MU69 the most distant object ever visited by humanity. 
However, MU69 is extremely faint, and only barely detectable with the Hubble
Space Telescope.  I will discuss how we made kernel density estimators for
the faint images from Hubble and combined them with Markov Chain Monte Carlo
techniques to build a probability cloud of where MU69 would be during the
encounter.  We also used this probability cloud to observe several stellar
occultations of MU69, watching stars blink out for less than a second in
order to tell us the size and shape of MU69.  These techniques show the
power of combining modern numerical probability estimates with a strong
forward model to pull the best possible prediction out of poor-quality data.

**Dr. Simon Porter** is a co-investigator on NASA's New Horizons Kuiper
Belt Extended Mission, and works at the Southwest Research Institute in

<span class="talk-title">Hacking Lego!  Computer generated Lego
instructions!</span>

I like Lego, but the idea of making large sculptures without some sort of
blueprint was intimidating.  Instead of going to art school, I wrote a tool
that uses a 3D object or scan and converts it into a sort of Lego
instructions that I could use as a guide.  Easy giant Lego sculptures! 
Well, easy to that step.  Actually getting the parts and putting it together
is a different talk.  Easy giant Lego sculpture ... instructions!

This talk will cover what was learned in the process of making this tool,
including some general thoughts about leveraging libraries in your code.

**Michael** is an award-winning Lego sculptor who is banned from ever
becoming one of those fancy "Lego Certified Professionals" that get all the
press.  After years of being slightly ashamed of his hobby, he finally gave

<span class="talk-title">Computers are fast!  But how come they sometimes
feel slow?</span>

It's super-important for computers to feel responsive.  Everyone from 
academic HCI researchers to revenue-focused product managers have been 
telling us this for years.  And yet, even as computers have gotten faster 
and faster, it often feels like the software we use daily has gotten slower! 

What's the deal with that?  Why is latency so hard to minimize, and how can we
even measure or detect that?  How can we make things better for users, either 
by making things speedier or just making it feel like they are?

This talk will cover all of that and more.  We'll focus largely on games,
as competitive-level gamers demanding frame-perfect input over severe
network constraints are a particularly extreme (and interesting!) edge case.

**Mike** is a Berlin-based artist and engineer. They make interactive art, 
experimental games, and software tools designed to spark intellectual curiosity
and inspire people to become self-motivated learners.

<span class="talk-title">`/etc/services` is made of people! (and also
ports!)</span>

Every computer, Windows, Mac, and *nix alike, includes some variation of the
`/etc/services` file, the rare file that is both machine-usable and
human-readable, so that applications and people alike can know what ports
are meant to be used for what purposes.  But the further you go into this
13,000-line file, the more traces of humanity you see &mdash; names, email
addresses, and dates paired with information about ports and the apps that
claim them.  Who are these folks?  How did their names get in the file that
came with your OS?  Why does "`chipper`" get port 17219 and "`octopus`"
claim port 10008?  Who oversees this vital file that puts the "`ssh`" with
port 22 when you `netstat`?  And how could you get your own piece of
port-assignment glory?

<span class="talk-title">Observability in the Kitchen: Improve Your
Breadmaking Skills with Open-Source Monitoring!!</span>

I love to bake.  A few months ago, I became interested in the art of
making one's own sourdough, a type of bread that, due to its fermentation
process, is a much healthier alternative to bread that is
readily available today.  The sourdough breadmaking process is a
fascinating combination of biology and physics, but working with natural
starters can be difficult because they are very sensitive to variations in
temperature and humidity.

It is fun and useful to leverage inexpensive sensors, Raspberry Pis, and
Prometheus (a monitoring system written in Go) to monitor the humidity and
temperature of my sourdough cultures in order to gain insight into how these
parameters affect the growth of each type of culture.  The result? 
Analytical insights into an age-old breadmaking process via graphical
reports and alerting rules.

I am going to share my delicious and metric-filled breadmaking process,
hopefully inspiring attendees to see how modern-day tooling written in Go
can be used to enhance traditional fields.

<span class="talk-title">My, my, TTY!</span>

The TTY abstraction in modern UNIX-like systems is ancient, complex, and
nearly invisible to newcomers.  It just works, except when it doesn't.  I'll
lead a brief tour of the history behind the terminal windows we use each
day, from paper teletypes and serial links to `gnome-terminal`, `ssh`, and
`screen`.

<span class="talk-title">Software patterns ... from the 9th century?!!</span>

In 9th-century Europe, agriculture underwent a major refactoring &mdash; all to
change a single magic constant.  Traditionally, farmers left half their land
uncultivated, to let it recover depleted nutrients; now they started leaving
only a third fallow.  This generates 33% more food on the same land!  Sounds
like an easy win, right?

Not so fast.  The new three-field system took nearly two centuries to get
fully deployed to production!  Not everyone was happy with the pull request,
and a lot of infrastructure needed reconfiguring to support the new model.

Sound familiar?  It should!  We sometimes convince ourselves programming is
an exceptional discipline, with new and unique challenges.  But many of our
craft's deepest problems are more general than we realize.  Backward
compatibility; systematic trade-offs; pipelines and bottlenecks; the
importance of good tooling &mdash; all of these had their part to play in the long
and difficult transition from two- to three-field agriculture.

**Michael Arntzenius** studies programming languages, in theory and
practice.

<span class="talk-title">Everything the light touches is a triangle: how
computers draw!</span>

Even though you often can't see them, almost everything a computer draws is
a triangle!  Including curves, 3D surfaces, and your favorite video game characters!
We will discuss why triangles are unique and cool, and how they unlock much of the
'magic' behind 3D computer graphics and rendering.  But it's not really magic!

<span class="talk-title">This one simple 600-year-old trick makes your
website more accessible!</span>

'Accessibility and the Web' sounds like a thoroughly modern set of
challenges, but it includes problems that people have been trying to solve
for hundreds of years.

In medi&aelig;val times, a knight being able to recognise a friend or foe at
a distance was a matter of life and death.  Rules evolved around the coats
of arms they bore to make identifying each other easier, giving birth to the
science of heraldry.  The most important one of those rules is around colour
contrast.

I'll talk about why colour contrast is so important to accessibility, and
then I'll take us on a whirlwind tour through the history of heraldry before
showing how rules that originated on the tournament ground inform our best
practices here in the 21st century.

recognition!</span>

An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is a device that can sense motion and
orientation.  If you combine IMUs with machine learning, you can detect
gestures!  For last Halloween, I built a [magic wand](https://github.com/jewang/gesture-demo) that
combines IMUs, machine learning, and DIY electronics to detect different
gestures when waving the wand.  In this talk, we'll go over the steps I took
to build the wand and how you can do it too!  Hardware prototyping is

<span class="talk-title">Making blackout poetry with computers!</span>

Blackout poetry creatively subverts a source text by blacking out most of
its words with a marker or other writing implement, in the process revealing
a poem hidden within.  I like blackout poetry so much, I decided to teach my
computer to turn any arbitrary web page into blackout poetry at the press of
a button.  In this talk, I'll discuss why blackout poetry is cool; what we
might learn from teaching computers to create it; and how I went about
building a browser extension that could generate moderately coherent
blackout poetry from arbitrary English text.  Then I'll go over why and how
I ended up transforming my blackout poetry generator into a mixed-initiative
blackout poetry composition tool that brings a human poet back into the

minutes!</span>

Control theory is a branch of science and engineering dedicated to
understanding  and analyzing systems, how they respond to input, and how to
control them.  Learning about control theory has changed the way I view the
world &mdash; having the tools to think about the stability of systems and the
mechanics of closed-loop feedback has been far more widely applicable than
I'd thought.  Control theory is also a fun way to see the practical
applications of math that is normally abstract (it turns out that imaginary
numbers can actually reflect properties of systems that we intuitively think
of!).  Plus, it's lots of fun to watch robots move around!

<span class="talk-title">Fast code! By removing all branches!</span>

Performance optimization should never be your first concern when creating a
solution, and run-time code generation is always a measure of last resort.

But when I was faced with the seemingly insurmountable task of making .NET
2.0 serialization as fast as hand-tuned assembly in a Delphi framework, it
was time to break all rules and resort to the dirtiest of tricks to make the
impossible possible.

In this talk I will illustrate how I used run-time code generation,
elimination of conditional branches, and some dangerous assumptions to beat
an already blazing fast solution to the finish.

**Jerry** was educated in the Netherlands, lives in Australia, and now
works for a Californian company.  He loves challenges that seem
insurmountable and often forgets to define the boundaries of the box, which

discarded FPGA hardware!!!</span>

Racing the beam is a technology that was used in the 1977 Atari 2600 console
to display game images on a computer system that did not have enough memory
to store the full image.  Ray tracing is the holy grail of computer graphics
rendering.  And FPGAs are chips with programmable gates that can be used to
implement all kinds of hardware accelerators, from telecommunications to
real-time image processing.

In this talk, I show how you can bring these three pieces together and
create, on hardware that can be purchased on eBay for just a couple of
dollars, a demo in the style of the late eighties and nineties, where the
main goal was simply to show a neat visual effect on an underpowered

In this talk we'll talk about NaN-boxing, an especially beautiful bit-level
hack that might be running on your computer right now!

The floating point standard defines a special value called Not-a-Number

precision NaNs come with a payload of 51 bits which can be used for whatever
you want &mdash; including using the payload to represent *all other*
non-floating point values and their types at runtime in dynamically typed
languages.

Instead, we focus on moving heat around inside the device, directing it to
where we want it. We can cook two different foods to two different
temperatures! How does this work?  Linear algebra, heuristics, and some clever
hardware. Join me as I give an introduction to the magic that makes this work!

over keyboards to imbue computers with new capabilities.  Ori also
enjoys cooking.

<span class="talk-title">"Wheels within whiles!" or possibly "Whiles within
wheels!"</span>

I built a multi-layer stack of emulations to include 150 years of digital
computing tech &mdash; from a (relatively) modern laptop through 5 layers of
emulation to Charles Babbage's 1840's Difference Engine &mdash; using various
bits of code I had lying around.  In the process, I asked
myself: *"why do I have that code lying around!?!"*

This started me thinking about emulation, the whys and ways of its uses:

- A practical way to extend the life of mature software
- A tool for conservation, to help understand the design[er]s of past machines
- An aid to communication with possibly remote co-designers on future machines

Emulation can help communicate through space and time!

I'll go over some of my favorite layers from that emulation stack and talk
about aspects of each, and lessons learned along the way.

The day **Mike** was born, you could count the fully functional stored
program electronic digital computers in the world on the fingers of one
hand.  He started messing with tech (mostly telecom and video games) when
transistors were overtaking tubes in computers, and has long been interested
in the history of technology to better understand the human context of its
development, "how we got here", and the roads not taken.

<span class="talk-title">`if` ... `then` ... `else` had to be
invented!</span>

60 years ago, several of the world's foremost computer scientists came
together to create the first international programming language standard. 
The language they created, Algol, is remembered for introducing block
structure and for sparking controversy over exactly what it means to pass a
parameter to a function.  But Algol's creators also wrestled for years with
the core question of how to communicate that in one circumstance a computer
should do a certain thing, and in different circumstances it should do
something different.  I will describe the paradigm of conditional program
execution that existed before Algol, the alternatives that the language's
creators considered, the final form they chose, and how it shaped our
thoughts going forward.
