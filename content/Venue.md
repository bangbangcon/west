# Where is !!Con West 2019?

We're excited to bring **!!Con West 2019** to scenic Santa Cruz, California,
on the campus of [UC Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/), on February 23rd
and 24th.  Santa Cruz is a joy of coastal California redwoods, about an
hour's drive from the bustle of Silicon Valley.  We'll be holding **!!Con
West** in the [Jack Baskin
Auditorium](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jack+Baskin+Auditorium+101/@36.9997031,-122.0630586,17.32z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808e4175229558fb:0x8d521799d868891c!8m2!3d37.000183!4d-122.0623527)
from about 10am to 5pm each day.

We anticipate having capacity for approximately **175 attendees** at this
year's **!!Con West**, in addition to our speakers and organizers.

## Alcohol-free and all-ages

**!!Con West** is an **alcohol-free event**.  All ages are welcome.

## Gender-neutral restrooms

The venue will have two single-occupancy gender-neutral restrooms in the
same building as the auditorium; additionally, there are gender-labeled
restrooms in adjacent buildings.

## Lactation room

A secure, private space will be made available for anybody who needs a
lactation room.  Please ask a conference organizer, and we'll be happy to
get you access.

## CART captioning

**!!Con West** will have CART ("Communication Access Realtime
Transcription", or "Computer-Assisted Real-Time", depending on who you ask)
live transcription in English.

## Getting to Santa Cruz
We are committed to making **!!Con West** accessible to as many attendees as we
can, and are searching for more transportation options. We will update this
section as we find more of them!

### By car
The best way to get to Santa Cruz from most of the Peninsula is by way of CA-17,
which takes you from CA-85 through the Santa Cruz mountains into the city;
this takes about 45 minutes with no traffic.  Another option, if coming from
San Francisco, is to drive down by way of Half Moon Bay on CA-1, which would
take about an hour and a half without traffic.  Of course, since this is the
Bay Area, both of these routes are in fact prone to traffic, which could
delay you substantially, especially during peak hours!  On rainy days,
CA-17's mountain roads have been known to take some overconfident drivers by
surprise, so be extra careful and anticipate delays from crashes if
conditions are less-than-perfect.

### By air
The best options for getting in and out of the Bay Area by air are either
through San Francisco (SFO), or through San Jose (SJC).  There are tradeoffs
for each; there are more flights in and out of SFO, but SJC is about half an
hour to an hour closer to Santa Cruz. Both airports have shuttle options to
Santa Cruz, if you don't wish to rent a car (example options by UCSC are
[here](https://taps.ucsc.edu/travel/airport-shuttles.html).

### By other alternatives including public transit
Santa Cruz is somewhat remote and the public transit options are limited,
but getting there without driving or flying is possible!

There are [Greyhound](https://www.greyhound.com) options from
San Francisco and Oakland to [Santa Cruz Greyhound Station](https://locations.greyhound.com/bus-stations/US/Santa-Cruz).

The nearest Amtrak/Caltrain station is San Jose Diridon Station (SJC).

If you're coming from Anaheim, Burbank, or Los Angeles and wish to take a bus,
[Megabus](https://us.megabus.com/) offers a few options to San Jose Diridon Station (SJC).

From San Jose Diridon Station to Santa Cruz, you can take:
- [bus 17](https://www.scmtd.com/en/component/systemmap/17/20192)
- Greyhound
- taxi (cost estimate is about $100)
- rideshare (cost estimate is about $50)

### From Santa Cruz city center to Jack Baskin Auditorium without a car
Santa Cruz Metro offers several bus lines within the city. A few of them will
get you to the auditorium from the city center. Please consult the [Santa Cruz
Metro website](https://www.scmtd.com/en/routes) or Google Maps for the bus
schedule.

There are rideshare like Lyft and Uber, and car sharing programs like Zipcar
available in Santa Cruz.

## Venue accessibility

We want to make **!!Con West** accessible to as many attendees as possible.
If you have questions about our venue, or the accessibility thereof, please
