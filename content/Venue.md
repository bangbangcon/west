# Getting to !!Con West 2020

We're excited to bring **!!Con West 2020** to scenic Santa Cruz, California,
on the campus of [UC Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/), from February 29
to March 1.  Santa Cruz is a joy of coastal California redwoods, about an
hour's drive from the bustle of Silicon Valley.  We held **!!Con
West** in the [Jack Baskin
Auditorium](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jack+Baskin+Auditorium+101/@36.9997031,-122.0630586,17.32z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808e4175229558fb:0x8d521799d868891c!8m2!3d37.000183!4d-122.0623527), 
with registration and continental breakfast starting at 9am each day, and talks ending around 5pm.

## Getting to Santa Cruz

### By car from the Bay Area

- The best way to get to Santa Cruz from most of the Peninsula is by way of
  CA-17, which takes you from CA-85 through the Santa Cruz mountains into the
  city.
- Please make sure you leave sufficiently early, as CA-17 gets heavy traffic
  southbound on weekends.
- Another option, if coming from San Francisco, is to drive down by way of Half
  Moon Bay on CA-1, which would take about an hour and a half without traffic.
- On rainy days, CA-17 can present adverse conditions, including car crashes and
  mudslides, sometimes even leading to closure of the highway and long delays.
- Please make sure to drive carefully and check the local news for transit
  conditions.

If you're interested in carpooling, please join [our carpool
Slack]() and find your carpool buddies.

### By air

The best options for getting in and out of the Bay Area by air are either
through San Francisco (SFO), or through San Jose (SJC).  There are tradeoffs
for each; there are more flights in and out of SFO, but SJC is about half an
hour to an hour closer to Santa Cruz. Both airports have shuttle options to
Santa Cruz, if you don't wish to rent a car (UCSC has a decent
[list of options](https://taps.ucsc.edu/travel/airport-shuttles.html)).

### By other alternatives including public transit

- Santa Cruz is somewhat remote and the public transit options are limited, but
  getting there without driving or flying is possible!
- There are [Greyhound](https://www.greyhound.com) options from San Francisco
  and Oakland to [Santa Cruz Greyhound
  Station](https://locations.greyhound.com/bus-stations/US/Santa-Cruz).
- The nearest Amtrak/Caltrain station is San Jose Diridon Station (SJC).
- If you're coming from Anaheim, Burbank, or Los Angeles and wish to take a bus,
  [Megabus](https://us.megabus.com/) also offers a few options to San Jose
  Diridon Station (SJC).

### From San Jose Diridon Station to Santa Cruz, you can take:

- The [Highway 17
  Express](https://www.scmtd.com/en/component/systemmap/17/20192) bus
- [Greyhound](https://www.greyhound.com)
- a taxi (estimated cost about $100)
- a rideshare (estimated cost about $50)

Extremely adventurous attendees could choose to bike to Santa Cruz; from the
middle of the Peninsula, [one possible
route](https://www.strava.com/routes/11228019) is about 45 miles with about
3,800ft of elevation gain.  (If you try this, or have a better route, [let us
know](mailto:west-2020@exclamation.foundation)!)
