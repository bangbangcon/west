# Frequently asked questions

## What's all this?

[!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com) (pronounced "bang bang con") is a
two-day conference of ten-minute talks about the joy, excitement, and
surprise of computing that's been held annually in New
York [since 2014](http://bangbangcon.com/2014). Due
to
[massive demand](http://composition.al/blog/2017/03/31/scaling-bangbangcon/),
!!Con was expanded to the west coast of the US in 2019. We are so excited to bring !!Con
West back in 2020, and it will be held in Santa Cruz, California, on
the campus of [UC Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/), on February
29th and March 1st.

## Why did you bring !!Con to the west coast?

In our five years of organizing !!Con, we've learned that there's a huge amount
of demand for what we're doing. This is a great problem to have, but it means
that we're constantly having to disappoint people. Thereâ€™s only so much that
our small team of volunteers can do.

The long-term solution to our inability to meet demand is for there to be a lot
more conferences inspired by !!Con, in a lot more places, organized by a lot
more people.  A new generation of conference organizers will need to step up.
In fact, that's already happening --
[PromptConf](https://promptconf.com), [EnthusiastiCon](https://www.enthusiasticon.de/), and [StarCon](https://starcon.io/) are three
examples of !!Con-inspired, independently organized events.

But the existence of all these great conferences hasn't taken the pressure off
!!Con. If anything, the demand for !!Con has only increased as more and more
people experience the magic and fun of this conference format. In 2018, for
instance, !!Con got nearly 300 talk proposals for only thirty talk slots. It's
clear that we need to expand, not only to better serve our existing audience,
but also to better serve those who can't easily travel to New York for the
weekend.

## How big an event will this be?

Last year, !!Con West was about 200 attendees, including around thirty
speakers, and was a two-day single-track conference.  We expect !!Con West
2020 to be about the same size.

## How is !!Con West different from !!Con in NYC?

The west-coast version of !!Con is necessarily different from the
east-coast version in certain ways. For starters, the !!Con West venue is very
different from the middle of Manhattan or Brooklyn, where all the previous
!!Cons have been held, and this has an impact on the conference experience. 
New York attendees regularly get to our venue on
public transit, and wander out to
restaurants for lunch while making it back in time for the afternoon talks;
these are dramatically more difficult in Santa Cruz!  On the other
hand, in Santa Cruz, attendees can walk out of the building
and three minutes later be strolling through a beautiful redwood forest. 

We've made some changes to the logistics of !!Con
when it seems like the right approach, but we feel that we've retained the important aspects
of the original !!Con's
[aesthetic](https://recompilermag.com/issues/extras/toward-a-bangbangcon-aesthetic/),
while enthusiastically embracing the physical and social geography of the west
coast, Santa Cruz, and UC Santa Cruz.

## Who's responsible for !!Con West?

!!Con West is being organized by [a team of
volunteers](/index.html#who-s-organizing) -- some of us were involved in
!!Con West last year, some have organizing experience from !!Cons previous, and some of
us are brand new this year.  One of our goals in !!Con West is to incubate
a new generation of conference organizers; if you're interested in
joining us in future years, please get in touch at the conference!

Additionally, !!Con West's parent organization is the [Exclamation
Foundation](https://exclamation.foundation), which provides logistical
support that we share between !!Cons, including managing our bank accounts,
and providing a legal entity that our sponsors can do business with.  If
you need to get in touch with Exclamation Foundation, you can [send the
Board of Directors some e-mail](mailto:board@exclamation.foundation).

## What is UC Santa Cruz's involvement in !!Con West?

The [Baskin School of Engineering](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/) at UC Santa Cruz
contributed seed funding to help launch our inaugural !!Con West in 2019,
and a
couple members of the organizing team have a UCSC affiliation.

## While the UCSC graduate student strike is going on, does attending the conference count as crossing the picket line?

We talked to some of the organizers of the graduate student strike -- they
have told us that "the strike organizing committee doesn't consider !!Con
West over the weekend to be crossing the picket line".  All the same, we
hope that you'll educate yourself about why the graduate students are
striking, and if you can, [donate to their strike
fund](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-fund-for-striking-workers-at-ucsc/donate). 
We have a [Twitter thread with more on
this](https://twitter.com/bangbangconwest/status/1230891386574004224), and
we'll have even more about it at the conference!!
