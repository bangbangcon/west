**!!Con** (pronounced "bang bang con") **West** is a two-day conference of
ten-minute talks about the joy, excitement, and surprise of computing, and the
west-coast successor to [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/)!  We're looking
forward to seeing you in Santa
Cruz, California, on the campus of [UC Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/), on
**February 29th and March 1st, 2020!**

## How do I get tickets?

!!Con West tickets will be released in **two batches** this year:

- The first batch will be released on **Saturday, January 18th, at noon
  Pacific**.
- The second batch will be released on **Thursday, January 23rd, at 10am
  Pacific**.

!!Con West was a **completely sold out** conference last year, so buy your
tickets quickly!  This year, we're also adding a group of tickets reserved
for first-time !!Con attendees (on the honor system, of course); we'd love to
expand the !!Con crowd, so if you know someone who's been to a !!Con before
and want to check it out for yourself, these tickets are for you!

You can buy your tickets [on our Eventbrite
page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/con-west-2020-tickets-89355796593).  Our
tickets are pay-what-you-want; our recommendation for a ticket price, to pay
for yourself, is $128, but if your employer will be reimbursing your
attendance (or if you'd like to support our sliding-scale ticket efforts by
paying for yourself and someone else!), we'd request a ticket price of $256. 
And, of course, if cost is a barrier to you attending !!Con West, feel free
to purchase a half-price ticket at $64 -- or set any other price that you'd
like to pay for a ticket!

## Who's speaking?

We have [28 incredible speakers this year](speakers), including our two
amazing keynote speakers, [isis agora
lovecruft](speakers#isis-agora-lovecruft) and [Erin Rose
Glass](speakers#erin-rose-glass)!  We **can't wait** to hear all of them,
and we hope that you'll be just as excited as we are.
