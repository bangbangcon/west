**!!Con** (pronounced "bang bang con") **West** is a two-day conference of ten-minute talks about the joy, excitement, and surprise of computing, and the west-coast successor to [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/)!  Join us in Santa Cruz, California, on the campus of [UC Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/), on **February 23-24, 2019!**

!!Con West is a pay-what-you-want conference, but tickets are now **sold
out**.  But if you missed the registration, don't fret: we still encourage
you to [get on the ticket
waitlist](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/con-west-2019-tickets-54792734544)!

!!Con West will also be livestreamed and recorded, speaker permitting!

## Who's speaking?

Two amazing keynote speakers (<a href='speakers#lynn-cyrin'>Lynn Cyrin</a>
and <a href='speakers#vj-um-amel'>VJ Um Amel</a>), and <a

this year's talk line-up, and we know that you will be too -- <a
href="speakers">check it out</a>!
